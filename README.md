# ARIMA
Arima model

A moving average model is an auto regressive model. To recap: an auto regressive model is a predictive time series model that believes you can predict the future based on the historical values of that what you want to predict. Suppose you want to predict the popularity score of Trump. An auto regressive model predicts Trump’s popularity based on his popularity of the previous days. A Moving Average (MA) model takes the average of his past popularity. Based on how many days you look in the past and how you combine them together, you get different type of MA’s (weighted moving average).

Mind I gave an explanation of the predictive MA model, not the MA decomposition filter.
